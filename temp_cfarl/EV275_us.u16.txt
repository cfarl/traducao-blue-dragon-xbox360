Hey!
Shu!
Shu!
Shu-u-u-u!
Are you guys okay?
"Well, what about you? Kluke told me what happened."
I'm okay. What about Zola? She isn't here?
No.
That's Zola for you. She probably made a clean escape. 
I'll bet she went back to King Jibral. She can take care of herself.
I guess... 
"Shu, how did this happen? How did we get away from Nene?"
"That wasn't a dream, was it?"
"He was going to crush us, wasn't he...?"
It wasn't a dream.
"Jiro, do you remember when Nene called us ""vessels?"""
"Yes, I remember that, all right. Those light spheres that we swallowed were actually Nene's soul."
I'm guessing the reason he was having us use magic was so that it would develop and nourish his soul.
And that was in order to cure the rapid-aging disease he has.
"He put on this act to make it seem like he was killing us,"
so we would grow the resolve to not give up.
But the reason he did this was so that we'd all build up the magic.
"So, we can't use magic anymore? "
"If he doesn't need us, then why are we still wearing these collars?"
But I used magic.
What?!
"It was so intense, I wasn't sure what was happening, but I knew it was magic. "
That's what allowed us to escape!
...
"Yeah. At the time, I thought we should all just run away. "
Can you believe I actually thought something like that?
You gave up! That's not like you!
"Yeah, I know... I gave up."
"Jiro, I think I finally understand. "
"Giving up, or running away, isn't always a bad thing. "
"I mean, not if we live to fight another day. "
It's just all part of the bigger plan... you know?
...
...
"I realized that ""I won't give up"" is not always the answer."
