Go away!
Hello? Who's there?
You must not enter...
"Hey, where are you?"
Don't!
Uh... why not?
This mist is dangerous.
"You are correct. This is the Land of Exile, where the banished ones live in the cursed mist. "
What?! Then... why are you here? Were you banished?
Yes. I am a criminal.
Maro so scared.
"Travelers, if you could, would you be so kind as to go to the village of the Gorgo tribe. "
"Once there, tell my dear Sura-Sura not to ring the bell. And to forget..."
Forget what?
Sura-Sura will know what that means.
"It must be something personal, Shu."
"All right, then. We really don't know what your reasons are, but sure, we'll help you out. Just head to the Gorgo village, right?"
The Gorgo tribe - that's the one with all those giants.
It's not too far from here. We can be the messengers.
Thank you. I am counting on you...
