Yasato!
"So you came. It cannot be helped, then. "
We have no choice but to defeat you.
"But, Yasato, you mean you're on his side now?!"
Let's do it!
We can't!
...
There's no way we can fight 'em!
"Stop this, Yasato!"
I apologize to you. My master was very angry that I had allowed you all to escape. 
Master Nene has modified my system to prevent that from happening again. 
"If you want to save Lady Kluke, it's necessary to destroy me first."
"We're your friends, Yasato!"
"We're your friends, Yasato! We can't do that! "
Please! Destroy me!
