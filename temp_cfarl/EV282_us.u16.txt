Don't do it!
No! Let go!
"No, I won't!"
Aiiiieeeee!
Let go of me! I want to die!
"What, are you crazy? You trying to kill yourself?!?"
"Yes, that was the idea!"
You expect me to just walk away?
This has nothing to do with you!
So what?!
I have nothing left to live for. I'd be better off dead!
You'd give up on living?
"Enough already! ""Don't give up! Don't give up!"" That's what they all say."
But I don't care how many times I hear it. 
They're nothing but words! You're just like everyone else! 
I don't understand! Why are you doing this?
I'm alone...
Alone?
My parents are gone... that monstrous tree ate them. 
They died trying to save me!
Do you know how awful it is living as an orphan? 
To know your whole life that your parents died for you? I can't go on living like this... 
Yeah... but still... 
"Please! You just got here, didn't you?"
You'll never understand!
You don't know what it's like to live with that monster. 
There's nothing good here anymore. 
We just wait to be eaten. I'd rather be dead.
I can't take living anymore! Would you just let me die?!
"Hey, no way! I would destroy that thing!"
I would put an end to that... monster tree!
That's easier said than done.
"Oh, come on! Is it easy to throw away the life your parents died for? "
Do you think this would make them happy? 
Who cares?
Just shut up!
Do you think you're the only one whose parents were slaughtered by monsters? 
Who has to laugh when she'd rather cry? You're not the only one suffering! 
...
"Oh, whoa. Didn't mean to preach..."
I know what you mean. I do. It's just...
"Ah, forget it. There's just no point anymore. "
"I thought I had to save you, but okay, whatever..."
...
I don't care if you want to throw it all away. 
"I could never give up like that. But hey, that's just me, I guess... "
I'll never give up. 
"I'm not gonna sit around here, waiting to be eaten by some tree! I won't!"
...
"I did it. Without the light sphere, I was able to..."
Shu? What are you doing?
"Jiro, I'm going to get my magic back again."
"Yeah, but... If you couldn't do it before... "
"Back then, I didn't try hard enough."
I don't think I truly believed in myself. 
But now I think I could do it!
"So, why the change of heart?"
Because of her.
Huh?
?
"This girl, she just tried to kill herself."
What!?
It sucks to give up and die. 
"It's easy to say: ""Don't give up."" "
"But unless you turn those words into strength, you won't get strong. "
You can't even live. 
"But now, after all we've been through, I know what it takes to say: ""I won't give up!"""
