"It's the same thing! Nene goes from village to village, doing whatever he can "
"to stir up fear, and then he enjoys it as people get more and more afraid!"
...
It's awful! Nene's so mean!
...
I can't take this anymore. There's no way this can go on. 
I won't let this happen! 
!
Everyone! We're going to help you!
I need to get my power back!
Magic! Come back to us!
It's the same... the same feeling that I had!
I get it! Now I understand. Our magic lies in our hearts! 
Our hearts are creating the magic for us... 
"Yes, it's in our hearts."
I feel it. If I could just make it my own...
I can use real magic.
