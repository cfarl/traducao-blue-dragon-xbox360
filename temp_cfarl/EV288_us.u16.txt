Wait!
Huh?
That girl... 
Here... I baked this. 
It's just some sweets. But I hope you like them.
"Uh, gee, thanks!"
I'm sorry about what I said before.
It's like you said. 
Once I saw how you all worked together to beat down that tree...
That worked better for me than any crummy sermon.
Good luck! I wish you all the best!
Do you like Shu?
Would you shut up?
I would say... I respect him.
Respect?
Oh-h-h-h!
"Heh. Respect you, hmm?"
Wha-a-at?
That'd be the first time anyone ever said that to you!
What were you two talking about before I got there?
"Shu, do you like her?"
Hey! I am warning you guys! Would you just knock it off!
