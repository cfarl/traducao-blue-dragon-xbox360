Shu... 
"Kluke, she... "
Kluke... 
"She has a high fever, and she's very restless... "
She's having bad dreams!
Kluke!
Stay away!
Haaaaa!
Why?! 
Why are you always so mean?! Stop!
...
I think she's seeing Nene in her dream... 
"You know, Kluke hasn't said anything about that time, at all..."
This stupid ring! It's not helping her!
Don't.
"But this ring, it's not working!"
Listen to me: There's one thing Kluke told me about the time when she was captured by Nene. 
?
"She said that because she had those rings, "
she was able to believe she'd be with us again. 
...
If we could just use magic...
