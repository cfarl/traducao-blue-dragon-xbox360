Shu!
Wow! You so cool!
Kluke!
Don't worry. I caught her in time. She'll be fine!
Thank goodness.
What is that?
"Nene, what is this?!"
Ahhh!
!
Yikes!
What happened?
"I don't know, but my hand's all numb."
Nene! What have you done?
"Kluke, come on! Snap out of it! Please!"
"Kluke, open your eyes! Kluke!"
Kluke!
Mmm... 
Kluke!
Shu... Jiro... 
Maro and Lady Zola are here too!
Thanks... all of you...
Are you all right?
"Yeah... Shu, put me down. I can stand on my own."
Oh. Sure.
Kluke... 
What's that?
Hm? What is this?
I'll get it off..
Yow!
Shu!
"That thing's gotta come off! Marumaro, gimme a hand!"
Gotcha!
Ack!
Aaahhh!
Grrrrrr!
"No, Shu! You're gonna hurt yourself!"
NO!
Shu!
"You should listen to her. Don't hurt yourself, now. "
NO!
You have one hour... 
One hour?!
"Yes, that's right. That's a bomb on her collar. "
"In less than an hour, it'll explode."
It will explode!
A bomb?
That bastard! I'll bet he's enjoying our suffering again!
...
"Want to stop it? I'm sure you do. If so, come on up to me. "
Try and get the detonator and stop the bomb before it explodes. 
I will!
