"Hey Kluke, happy birthday."
"Thank you, Shu."
"So, um, Jiro. Have you given Kluke your present yet?"
Not yet... 
"Listen, you two, I still don't know--"
"Here! This is your birthday present, Kluke!"
"Oh, it's lovely! Thank you!"
"Well! That's so unlike you, Shu."
"Well, it's a new world out there, so I figured there was gonna be new flowers around. "
Yes. I've never seen one like it.
"Yeah, Yeah! I know, it's great! Boy you have no idea how hard it was to find either! "
"Kluke, you know a while back there I started to realize that--"
"Whoa, wait a minute! Here's my present!"
"Thank you, Jiro. May I open it?"
Mm-hm. Please do!
"Wow! This is lovely, too!"
"I could make it into something pretty to wear, maybe a pendant or something for your hair... "
Just tell me. Whatever you'd like and I'll make it for you. 
"Me, too! Me, too, Kluke! Ask me! I could make you something too! Anything! "
But your flower will die...
"Well, we could turn it into a dried flower. Or we could make it into some potpourri. "
Kluke! You're always taking his side.
That's not true!
"Kluke, you have to make a decision."
What?!
"Come on! Tell us already, which one of us do you like?"
"Uh, can you guys wait..."
until my next birthday?
