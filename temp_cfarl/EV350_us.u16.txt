It's no good! Maro can't fight against Lady Zola!
...
Now you shall return that portion of my spirit that is in your keeping.
I first met this woman when she had suffered betrayal and was fleeing from war.
She was in despair over being powerless and not being able to help anyone.
She lost faith in people and cursed herself for her own lack of power...
I told her I could imbue her with power. 
And this woman embraced and accepted the magic.
...
"Since then, this woman has been my servant,"
"seeking out vessels for my soul to bring my youth back, and bring about the restoration of the planet."
That's when she focused on all of you.
...
Do you recall... when you swallowed the light spheres and the voice that told you to?
I do... uh.!?
That voice... Was it you?
It wasn't Nene?
"How could you do this, Zola? How could you betray us like this?"
"Unlike us, Zola has not made her magic into her own power yet..."
It's still Nene's soul. Perhaps he was using her as insurance.
"Why'd you do it, Zola? Why?"
Did you befriend King Jibral for Nene? Answer me!
Answer her!
"Yes! Once again, give me power..."
What!? What's going on here? That is... your light sphere...
I've cast your spirit away.
What!?
I've discovered I have my own power inside.
!
"Szabo, the collar of light!"
Szabo?
You betrayed me!
"If I was going to betray anyone, it wouldn't be Shu and his friends. It would be you, Nene!"
What are you saying?
Remember? I wanted power. I told you that.
And you showed me power like I'd never seen before.
I've been thinking about it ever since then. About just how powerful you'd be when you regained your youth again.
"Yes. From the start, it was your power I was after!"
Look at him!
The cause of Nene's illness is magic itself.
His soul was tremendously consumed by his magic.
"The more powerful the magic he controlled, the less his body could bear."
So then that was why he needed to develop a stronger soul...
But I am different. I know how to utilize...
this power!
