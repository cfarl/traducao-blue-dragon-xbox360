Stop!
"Don't do it, Zola!"
You don't have to follow the same path as Nene!
Lady Zola!
I will be the one to decide how to use this power.
Zola!
"Lady Zola, please don't do this!"
!
Huh?
"Now, it's over."
Lady Zola! You really are Maro's Lady Zola!
You really did it!
What a great plan! You really had us fooled!
Was this your plan? Is this what you wanted from the beginning?
Maybe so...
My heart was beaten down by betrayal once before...
"And I was tempted by what it was that Nene's magic had to offer, but now that's changed."
Because there was someone who taught me how to use power.
Who's that?
Szabo?!
"If Zola doesn't need it, I will take it!"
"Stop! Cough it up, now!"
I don't think so!
What's going on?
What's happening to Szabo?
It's not Szabo!
"Then, who?"
