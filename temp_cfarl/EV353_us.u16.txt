Whoa! That's the creature we saw in the murals!
The bio-weapon that destroyed the ancients' civilization... This is the beast's true form!
What's it doing in this place?!
Nene said he had discovered it in the ruins soon after he awoke from his sleep.
He cherished it as a last living remnant of his past that exists in this present time...
An era that had forgotten how to use magic.
"I am the same as you, mercenary!"
"I too awaited my chance, biding my time with Nene. "
Your magic looks appetizing! I shall consume every last bit of it!
I get it! Our ancestors didn't lose their magic. 
"To extend their lives, they locked their magic away! "
The memory of their magic was passed down through our bodies. 
Nene's spheres of light were the trigger that released those memories!
Kid! You're clever. Delectable! I will eat you all! Will destroy again! 
Will even eat those odious moons! 
The ancients were unable to completely defeat this creature with the moon lasers. 
But they were able to weaken it and seal it away... 
"If we don't stop this thing immediately, another disaster will be added to the world outside!"
This could be the worst one ever!
We are not going to let that happen!
"You are not going anywhere, Destroy! We're going to stop you!"
