What's going on? Where's our power?!
We're not doing any damage. We need to come up with a plan!
The mirrors! The light from all these mirrors is weakening our Shadows' power! 
What! What should we do?
The time for games is over. Now the end has come!
Szabo?!
Szabo!
You! What are you doing!
Yes!
We are even!
You're not getting away!
Punish the bad king!
Nene! Prepare yourself!
