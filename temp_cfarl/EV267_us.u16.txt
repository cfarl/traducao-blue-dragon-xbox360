It's working!
A little more! Keep pulling harder!
Yeah!
That's it... Just a little more... 
Now!
Whoa!
No!
It won't come off!
"What the heck is this, Nene?!"
These collars were never meant to explode. 
Capturing us was your plan all along.
You have all been superb! 
"Your persistence, your bravery, are all perfect vessels with which to nourish my soul!"
Nourish his soul!
What?!
I am an ancient creature. 
Relentless illnesses of age wrack my body. 
Do you understand my fear? 
"Others enjoy the strength and vibrancy of youth, "
while I alone suffer the degradation of extreme age. 
Why has that fate befallen me? Why must no one else know the fear I know? 
It's unforgivable... unforgivable. Unforgivable!
Heh-he-he-he-he! Feeling better?
"Yes. I'm better, Deathroy. "
My only friend who knows the ancient secrets I know. 
"Had you not survived, I would have gone insane from loneliness."
That's too bad.
"Time to regain power, my vessels!"
My vessels!
