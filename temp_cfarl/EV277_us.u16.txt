Hey!
Help me!
Hey!
Darn it! That didn't work either!
No way! How can a tree be stronger than an axe? Something's wrong here!
"Yes, something is wrong... with this entire village."
Huh?
Those trees keep us trapped in here.
Keep you trapped?!
"Yes, that's right. We are its food. "
There is a flesh-eating tree in the middle of our village.
A flesh-eating tree?!
You guys couldn't have shown up in a worse place for a rescue. 
"So... Tell me, where did you come from, anyway? "
Well...
That's what we'd like to know.
It's too bad. You've had a terrible twist of fate.
...
The flesh-eating trees are horrible. 
"Three or four times a year, they grab one of us to eat. "
"If we try to leave, the other trees block the way. "
"If we try to chop them off, well, you saw what happened..."
Could it be...?
Is Nene doing this?
Who else?!
