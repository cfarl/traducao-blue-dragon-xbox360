It's the gem from King Jibral...
"If it was stolen and destroyed, what's it doing here?"
What do you people think you're doing here?
Jeelala!
"Hey, Jeelala! Wanna explain to us what this ""stolen"" gem is doing here? "
You said it was stolen... but you lied!
Gwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"You see, I used this gem to gain what I wanted."
You mean Sura-Sura?
I've known Guru-Guru a long time. A good guy who cares about his friends. 
"When I showed him the fake shattered gemstone, he feared it would negatively affect relations with Jibral and our village. "
"He took the blame for me, the Chief. That fool. "
"Thanks to Guru-Guru, I can force her... uh... I mean, I don't like to force... "
I can slowly and patiently gain her heart!
What a stupid idea. You can't be serious!
"Hmph... puny scum... Now that you know the secret, I cannot let you leave."
Guards! Don't let them get out of here alive!
