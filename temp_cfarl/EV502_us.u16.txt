Wow! They're huge!
HELLO! Sura-Sura!
Are you looking for Sura-Sura?
We were asked to deliver a message to Sura-Sura by an exile from your village.
What?! Did you see Guru-Guru?
Guru-Guru?
"Yes, he stole the gemstone awarded by King Jibral. "
And tried to steal the holy power inside for himself. He's despicable. 
The village chief Jeelala managed to catch him and send him to the Land of Exile. 
A gem? 
It must be the gem that the previous king of Jibral sent to celebrate the many years of peaceful trade with your village.
"And like this ring, it encases the legendary power of the Jibral royal family."
You'll find Sura-Sura ahead near the bell tower. 
She says she made a promise to Guru-Guru to ring the bell.
"Everybody tells her that he's not coming back, but Sura-Sura is convinced he is."
