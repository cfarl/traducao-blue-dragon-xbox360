I see you're awake.
"Uh, yeah."
"Oh, I'm glad you slept so well. You've been out for three days! Three days! "
Did you know you were asleep for that long?
Three days?!
I found you lying unconscious near the village.
What about my friends?
"Oh, they're already awake, dear. I saw them in the plaza earlier. "
They were very worried about you because you didn't wake up. 
"As a matter of fact, the young girl was even crying. "
In the plaza?
You said this was a village. What's the name of this place?
This is Devour Village.
"Well, I'm Shu, from Talta Village. Thanks for helping me!"
