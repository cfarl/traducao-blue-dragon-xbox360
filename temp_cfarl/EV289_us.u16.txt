Maro really wants magic back!
"Believe me, I know how you feel, Marumaro."
But even Shu doesn't really understand the reason his magic is fully returned to him.
But Maro hates being protected all the time!
What?
Remember what happened last time!
"Yeah, that stunk!"
Errrrrr...
"Hey, Marumaro!"
"Hey, you need to breathe!"
Marumaro!
Aaa!
Err aaa! Maro almost died!
What should we do? 
"I know we shouldn't rely so much on magic, but... "
"I must admit, now I honestly want the power."
Yeah... 
But we shouldn't rush it. 
"If Shu could do it, we can probably do it too."
We can't give up. We need to believe.
Mn-hmm.
