"Welcome, my guests."
Welcome.
"As a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, you too have passed through many trials in your growth... "
Trials?
You call that a trial? 
Our life-and-death struggles are just a game for your enjoyment?
You rotten no-good bastard!
Wha--?!
Not scary! Kluke's bomb was just a lie! 
You wish to test me?
What will happen if I press this button? Don't you want to find out?
I can blow all you up right now if I want to... 
No! Don't!
Kluke!
Kluke!
"Nene, let her go!"
Come! Off!
Kluke!
Get this off!
Everyone... stay away! Please!
"No, never!"
