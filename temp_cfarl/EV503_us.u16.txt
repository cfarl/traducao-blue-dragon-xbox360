Sura-Sura?
Guru-Guru asked us to come.
You saw Guru-Guru?
"He said not to ring the bell, and to forget."
I see.
I'm ringing the bell to say that...
I won't ever forget about him. And I will never stop.
"I know he didn't steal that gemstone. Someone else did, and he took the blame."
So you're saying he was set up?
Jeelala!
You need to stop ringing the bell. 
Guru-Guru has been sent indefinitely to the Land of Exile. He'll never return to the village. 
Why don't you come to my place?
I told you before: I will never go with you!
I guess I have no choice...
"As we promised, we'll just take the bell away."
Don't do that!
"This way, you can't ring the bell anymore. Just give up. You can live with me at my place anytime. "
No! The bell... It rings out my feelings to him!
That stinks! He's a real jerk!
"Is that the village chief, Jeelala?"
Yes. He's a disgusting man who's been trying to force himself on me for a long time. I'm sure he's the one who stole the gem. 
Huh? Really?
Do you have any proof?
"Unfortunately, no. But it's said that he was made village chief under suspicious circumstances."
